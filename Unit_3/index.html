	<p1>Hello there!</p1>
	<p>My name is Shiva, and I’m a Graphic Designer, UI/UX designer, Photographer, and bookworm from Toronto. The short version? I like words and images—a lot, and designing with them is my specialty. My love for design stems from my passion to create while solving problems. It’s like art and math class combined– you get to create something beautiful while coming up with the best solution to use that design. From the very young age, I used art-any form of art- to represent myself, and I knew, I just knew I wanted to be an artist . </p>
